# Virtual ChatGPT Bot

### About

I thoroughly enjoy using ChatGPT for its impressive language capabilities, but the limitation of having only a web-based interface has been a downside. However, I discovered that Telegram has been gaining widespread popularity, prompting me to take action. I took it upon myself to create a straightforward Python code that transforms ChatGPT into a Telegram Bot. The process is simple—all you have to do is input your ChatGPT API key, and voilà! The integration works like a charm. Moreover, I have exciting plans to incorporate additional features in the future, enhancing the overall experience even further.
